## Beat Saber Mapping Software

This is a tool created to speed up the process of creating your first Beat Saber Map.

The application is built around the idea of abstracting away indiviudual notes and replacing them with prebuilt sets of notes called 'Rhythms' and spacers called 'Rests'.

Please note: this appliation is very much a work in progress and is not yet complete. You may experience crashes, bugs, and other issues.
Also note that some functions such as import and analysis do not currently have progress bars and features such as the Rhythm Editor are not yet implemented but will be added in the future.

*Special thanks to bsmg.wiki for their detailed beat saber map schemas.*
